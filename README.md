WealthFlow is a modern, responsive personal finance dashboard built to help users track income, expenses, and account balances in real-time.

Built using React and Firebase, this application features a modular component architecture and utilizes the Context API with useReducer for robust global state management. Unlike typical dashboards that rely on heavy charting libraries, WealthFlow implements a custom-built SVG charting engine for lightweight, performant data visualization.

Key Features :
1.)Real-time Dashboard: Instant updates on Balance, Income, and Expenses using Firebase Firestore.

2.)Transaction Management: Full Create, Read, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for financial entries.

3.)Responsive Design: A clean, mobile-first UI built with Tailwind CSS.
